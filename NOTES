Rate-limitations: 1 request every 10 seconds should be safe.
 \_ Reasoning: http://dev.twitter.com/pages/rate-limiting says that search.twitter.com is higher than the Rest API which is 350 per hour.
	Since 350 is 1 request every ~10.3 seconds, I would say it is safe to request once every 10 seconds. I don't want to push it and get anyone in trouble.


To debug with valgrind use this command:
valgrind --suppressions=bat_sig.supp ./executable
(Currently executable = main)

URL to use now: http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=%23@pocketnoagenda&from=adamcurry&rpp=1

Reasoning in using json: 
 \_ everything on one line makes it easier to search within it.
 \_ id_str, created_at
 \_ refresh_url makes it easy to update/check after initially starting the program
