To debug with valgrind use this command:
valgrind --suppressions=bat_sig.supp ./executable

URL to use now: http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=%23@pocketnoagenda&from=adamcurry&rpp=1

Reasoning in using json:

 \_ id_str, created_at
 \_ refresh_url makes it easy to update/check after initially starting the program
