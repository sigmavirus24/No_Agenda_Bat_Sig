This is a simple C program that users can run and will background for 30 minutes. It will be configurable by the user and will play a "jingle" of the user's choice to notify them that Adam has tweeted the bat-signal.

## DEPENDENCIES:
* [[libcurl|http://curl.haxx.se]]

* [[mpg123|http://www.mpg123.de]]

## INSTALLATION:
