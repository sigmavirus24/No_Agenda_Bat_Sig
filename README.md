This is a simple C program that users can run and will background for 30 minutes. It will be configurable by the user and will play a "jingle" of the user's choice to notify them that Adam has tweeted the bat-signal.

## DEPENDENCIES:
* libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se)
* GTK+2.0
* mpg123

## INSTALLATION:
1. In the directory containing src/ and jingles/ run the command "make".
2. The bat signal will be made in that directory and can be run from there (or wherever you desire to move it to).
